Detailed amino acid composition analysis
Total amino acid count
Interactive command-line interface

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
No additional dependencies required

Installation

Download the script:

bashCopyprotein_calculator.py

Make the script executable (Unix/Linux):

bashCopychmod +x protein_calculator.py
Usage
Basic Usage
bashCopypython protein_calculator.py
When prompted, enter your protein sequence using standard one-letter amino acid codes.

Input Format

Use standard one-letter amino acid codes (case-insensitive)
Valid amino acids: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y
No spaces or special characters

Calculations
Molecular Weight

Calculated using standard amino acid residue masses
Accounts for water loss in peptide bond formation
Formula: Sum of residue masses + water mass

Isoelectric Point (pI)

Calculated by finding pH where net charge is zero
Considers:

N-terminal charge
C-terminal charge
Side chain charges
pKa values of ionizable groups



Extinction Coefficients
Molar Extinction

Based on Tyr, Trp, and Cys content
Calculated at 280 nm
Units: M⁻¹cm⁻¹

Mass Extinction

Molar extinction coefficient divided by molecular weight
Units: (mg/mL)⁻¹cm⁻¹
